- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jdmpictures. I am fairly new to coding with currently only around 3-4 months of expeirence. I am looking to hopefully secure a job as a junior developer or similar 
position sometime in the future. Here you will mainly find projects I am currently or have been working on. Given my experience I'm certain there will be nothing exciting, the 
main purpose is for me to document my learning journey. 

My other interests include; photography, walking and travel.
