Hi, Iâ€™m @jdmpictures. I am fairly new to coding with currently only around 3-4 months of expeirence. I am looking to hopefully secure a job as a junior developer or similar 
position sometime in the future. Here you will mainly find projects I am currently or have been working on. Given my experience I'm certain there will be nothing exciting, the 
main purpose is for me to document my learning journey. 

I am and a avid walker, when I have time to do so. I am from the UK and absolutley love the Lake District, if you haven't been GO, right now! I also have a creative side which I like to express via photography and videography, mainly street photography and travel. Which is another one of my passions - having recently spent a month in both Thailand and Vietnam.  

Well a little bit of the more boring, erm, I mean formal stuff. I am currrently working as a fraud investigator for a major bank, of which, for obvious reason I will not be mentioning. Hopefully I can use some of the skills I will be developing to implement into some projects which I would be able to link to my current work.
